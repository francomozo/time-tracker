# Time Tracker App

This is a simple time tracker app that allows you to track the time you spend on different tasks.
It makes use of a states machine and an input/output handler.

## Usage
1. Define you custom states in the `time_tracker/config/states.json` file
2. Run the app with `python time_tracker.py`

## TODO
- [ ] Improve visualization for daily spent time using just the terminal
- [ ] Add higher level menu to visualize the spent time for any day
